## Directions
The player starts at the starting tile and rolls the dice to move up the board on the end tile. If the player lands on a ladder, the player is then moved up the board to the connecting tile. However, if the player lands on a snake, the player moves down the board to the connecting tile.

In order to win, a player's rolled dice must be the exact amount of tiles to land on the ending tile. If the number rolled on the dice is more than the required amount, the player's position moves back from the end tile to complete their dice roll.
